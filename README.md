# :robot: Dr. Cui's FURP Project (Spring 2024)
Research and Development of AMR Fleet Meta-Universe Simulator & Marker-Free 6D Motion Capture System 

## :gear: Basic Environment
To participate in this project, it's recommended that you set up your environment with the following:

Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Simulation Platform: Omniverse Isaac sim （compulsory）
 
## :books: Documentation & Resources
Below are some valuable resources and documentation to help you get acquainted with the tools and platforms we'll be using:

**Isaac Sim:**

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Progress
### Week 1-3
**Isaac Sim Learning**

All team members are expected to go through the Isaac Sim tutorials.
Individuals should try to replicate the tutorial results to gain hands-on experience with the simulation environment.

**Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) Group**

Familiar with ROS (Robot Operating System).
Practical exercises and experimentation with ROS are encouraged to understand the basics of robot software development.

**Motion Capture System Group**

Learn the theories behind Kalman Filter (KF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithms.
