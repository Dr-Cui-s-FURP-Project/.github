# :robot: Dr. Cui's FURP Project (Spring 2024)
Research and Development of AMR Fleet Meta-Universe Simulator & Marker-Free 6D Motion Capture System 

## :gear: Basic Environment
To participate in this project, it's recommended that you set up your environment with the following:

Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Simulation Platform: Omniverse Isaac sim （compulsory）
 
## :books: Documentation & Resources
Below are some valuable resources and documentation to help you get acquainted with the tools and platforms we'll be using:

**Isaac Sim:**

[NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim)

[Getting Started](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/core_api_tutorials/tutorial_core_hello_world.html)

[Tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Cs4y1a7hS/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=fc0fccd172256256b42fd83530583747)

**ROS (AMR project)**

[ros-noetic (recommended)](https://www.ros.org/)

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Progress
### Week 1-3
**Isaac Sim Learning**

All team members are expected to go through the Isaac Sim tutorials.
Individuals should try to replicate the tutorial results to gain hands-on experience with the simulation environment.

**Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) Group**

Familiar with ROS (Robot Operating System).
Practical exercises and experimentation with ROS are encouraged to understand the basics of robot software development.

**Motion Capture System Group**

Learn the theories behind Kalman Filter (KF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithms. 

### Week 4-6
more practice 

**Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) Group**

1. Begin setting up a simple environment within Isaac Sim, you can use the built-in environment.
2. Select any of the built-in AMR models and configure it.
3. Make the built-in AMR auto-move by commands.
4. Focus on enabling the AMR to perform basic tasks such as moving from one point to another and obstacle avoidance.

**Motion Capture System Group**

1. Design a virtual room within the simulation environment that will serve as the testbed for the motion capture system.
2. Place a sufficient number of cameras around the room to ensure full coverage of the space.
3. Place an object in the room that will be the subject of measurement.
4. Add multiple sensors, including cameras and radars, around the object to capture data from different angles and perspectives.
5. Begin collecting preliminary data and ensure the system is correctly capturing the necessary information.

## :raising_hand: Contributing
Please create a repo in our GitHub organization, naming your name + 'weekly report', then write an one-page learning note per week.

### :thumbsup: Good Practice
We strongly encourage all contributors to make full use of Git for version control. This not only ensures a robust workflow but also serves as valuable practice for your software engineering skills.

To help you get started or to serve as a quick reference, here's a handy [Git cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) provided by GitHub Education. It covers the most common Git commands and workflows that you'll likely use while contributing to this project.

Remember, becoming proficient with Git is a crucial skill in your software engineering toolkit. It allows for better collaboration, code management, and understanding of the software development lifecycle.
