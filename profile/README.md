# :robot: Dr. Cui's FURP Project (Spring 2024)
Research and Development of AMR Fleet Meta-Universe Simulator & Marker-Free 6D Motion Capture System 

## :gear: Basic Environment
To participate in this project, it's recommended that you set up your environment with the following:

Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Simulation Platform: Omniverse Isaac sim （compulsory）
 
## :books: Documentation & Resources
Below are some valuable resources and documentation to help you get acquainted with the tools and platforms we'll be using:

**Isaac Sim:**

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Progress
### Week 1-3
**Isaac Sim Learning**

All team members are expected to go through the Isaac Sim tutorials.
Individuals should try to replicate the tutorial results to gain hands-on experience with the simulation environment.

**Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) Group**

Familiar with ROS (Robot Operating System).
Practical exercises and experimentation with ROS are encouraged to understand the basics of robot software development.

**Motion Capture System Group**

Learn the theories behind Kalman Filter (KF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithms. 



## :raising_hand: Contributing
Please create a repo in our GitHub organization, naming your name + 'weekly report', then write an one-page learning note per week.

### :thumbsup: Good Practice
We strongly encourage all contributors to make full use of Git for version control. This not only ensures a robust workflow but also serves as valuable practice for your software engineering skills.

To help you get started or to serve as a quick reference, here's a handy [Git cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) provided by GitHub Education. It covers the most common Git commands and workflows that you'll likely use while contributing to this project.

Remember, becoming proficient with Git is a crucial skill in your software engineering toolkit. It allows for better collaboration, code management, and understanding of the software development lifecycle.
